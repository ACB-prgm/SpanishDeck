# SpanishDeck


### How To Download
If you are unfamilliar with GitHub, you download this deck by clicking on the green "code" button at the top right of this repository.  Then click the .zip option.

### How To Use
This deck is sorted into lessons by tags.  download the heirarchal tags addon [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/594329229) if you don't already have it. Suspend the entire deck in the browse tab by doing CMD+A, CMD+J.  Then select a tag and press CMD+A, CMD+J again to unsuspend all the cards in that tag, starting with "Lesson.1".  

There is a "SelfDirected" tag that is really just all of the cards I forgot to tag while I was making them and realized later.  You should be good to unsuspend that after ~ "Lesson10".  I also began making a "Medical" tag, but I started doing this recently, so don't depend on this too much as many medically related cards are not tagged as medical yet.

I would also highly reccomend using [SpanishDict](https://www.spanishdict.com/) in conjunction with this deck for practice and as an introduction to some of the concepts of Spanish.

### My Preferred Settings
I usually have 10 new cards/day, but this depends on your schedule.
